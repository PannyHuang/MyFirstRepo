    "You're right! Data Scientists use a wide range of libraries depending on the specific task. Here's a breakdown of some of the most commonly used libraries, categorized by their primary functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Manipulation & Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`pandas` (Python):**  The cornerstone of data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, along with powerful tools for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.\n",
    "* **`dplyr` (R):** Similar to `pandas`, `dplyr` offers a grammar of data manipulation for R. It simplifies data wrangling tasks with intuitive functions like `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `select()`.\n",
    "* **`numpy` (Python):** The foundation for numerical computation in Python. It provides powerful arrays and matrices, along with functions for linear algebra, random number generation, and more.\n",
    "* **`scipy` (Python):**  Builds upon `numpy` to provide advanced scientific computing capabilities, including optimization, integration, interpolation, signal processing, and more.\n",
    "* **`data.table` (R):** A fast and efficient data manipulation library in R, particularly useful for working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`matplotlib` (Python):**  A foundational plotting library in Python, offering a wide range of static, interactive, and animated visualizations.\n",
    "* **`seaborn` (Python):**  Built on top of `matplotlib`, Seaborn provides high-level functions for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.\n",
    "* **`ggplot2` (R):**  A powerful and versatile plotting library in R, known for its grammar of graphics that allows for highly customizable visualizations.\n",
    "* **`plotly` (Python & R):**  Creates interactive and web-based visualizations that can be easily shared and embedded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`scikit-learn` (Python):**  A comprehensive library for machine learning in Python. It offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.\n",
    "* **`tensorflow` (Python):**  A powerful deep learning library, commonly used for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "* **`keras` (Python):**  A high-level API for building and training neural networks, often used on top of `tensorflow`.\n",
    "* **`pytorch` (Python):**  Another popular deep learning library, known for its flexibility and ease of use.\n",
    "* **`caret` (R):** A comprehensive package for machine learning in R, offering a unified interface to various algorithms, cross-validation, and model tuning.\n",
    "* **`mlr3` (R):** A modern machine learning library in R, designed for flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Essential Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`requests` (Python):** For making HTTP requests to web APIs, fetching data from the internet.\n",
    "* **`BeautifulSoup` (Python):** For parsing HTML and XML data, extracting information from web pages.\n",
    "* **`json` (Python):** For working with JSON data, a common format for exchanging data.\n",
    "* **`os` (Python):** For interacting with the operating system, managing files and directories.\n",
    "* **`string` (Python):** For manipulating strings, performing text processing tasks.\n"
